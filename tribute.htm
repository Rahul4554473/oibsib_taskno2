                <h2>Early Life </h2>
                <p>
                    Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar, Bombay on 24 April 1973 to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin[better source needed] Maharastrian Marathi family. His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a Marathi-language novelist and poet while
                    his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry. Tendulkar's father named him after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. Tendulkar has three older siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. They were
                    his father's children by his first wife, who died after the birth of her third child. His brother Ajit played in Bombay's Kanga Cricket League.

                    Tendulkar spent his formative years in the Sahitya Sahawas Cooperative Housing Society in Bandra (East). As a young boy, Tendulkar was considered a bully, and he often picked fights with new children in his school.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As a child, Tendulkar was interested in both tennis and cricket. He particularly idolised American player John McEnroe, and emulated his hero by growing his hair long at the age of 7 or 8 years. At this time, Tendulkar also regularly wore tennis wristbands and headbands and carried a tennis racquet with him as a sign of his love for tennis.

                <h2>Early career </h2>
                <p>
                    On 14 November 1987, at age 14, Tendulkar was selected to represent Bombay in the Ranji Trophy for the 1987â€“88 season, but he was not selected for the final eleven in any of the matches, though he was often used as a substitute fielder.
                    A year later, on 11 December 1988, aged 15 years and 232 days, Tendulkar made his debut for Bombay against Gujarat at Wankhede Stadium and scored 100 not out in that match, making him the youngest Indian to score a century on debut in first-class cricket.
                    He was selected to play for the team by Bombay captain Dilip Vengsarkar after Vengsarkar watched him play Kapil Dev in Wankhede Stadium's cricket practice nets, where the Indian team had come to play against the touring New Zealand team. 
                    He followed this by scoring a century in his first Deodhar and Duleep Trophies, which are also Indian domestic tournaments.
